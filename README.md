# Wine-Quality-prediction
Overview
This repository contains the source code and resources for a Wine Quality prediction system built using machine learning techniques. The project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various attributes such as acidity, pH levels, and more. The model is trained on a dataset of wine samples with known quality ratings and uses supervised machine learning techniques to make predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the data directory. It includes information on various attributes of wine samples, including the target variable, which is the quality rating. The data is stored in a CSV format and is used for both training and evaluation of the machine learning model.

Requirements
To run the Wine Quality Prediction System, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
Python libraries and packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. You can install these dependencies using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

You are now ready to use the Wine Quality Prediction System.

Usage
This section describes how to use the Wine Quality Prediction System.

Predicting Wine Quality
To predict the quality of a wine sample, you can use the provided script. Here's how to use it:

bash
Copy code
python predict_wine_quality.py
Web Interface (Optional)
You can also deploy a web interface for users to predict wine quality by running:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to use the web interface.

Training
If you wish to retrain the model or experiment with different algorithms, you can do so by modifying the training script. The training data is located in the data directory.

To retrain the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning model can be evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or others. You can find the evaluation results in the results directory.
